### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is TimothÃ©e Mazzucotelli,
I learned computer science at a french university,
and now have a few years of experience in development,
particularly with Python.

I really enjoy sharing my code
and contributing to other projects!

You can see [a showcase of my projects on my website][showcase]
(sorry for the heavy GIFs and SVGs :sweat_smile:),
as well as [the list of my blog posts][blog].

Here are some [auto-updated][workflow]
stats about my published projects
([thanks Simon Willison!][sw-post]):

<!--marker-->
Total downloads: 998,698<br>
Downloads/month: 56,945<br>
Stars count: 887
<!--end-->

It ain't much (and it doesn't mean much either),
but I'm nonetheless proud to see
that what I created is used by others :heart_eyes:

You can see more about what I'm working on
on my [support page][support]!
